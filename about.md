Professionally I am a software engineer, specialized in front-end development using ReactJS. I am currently working with an awesome team at [Certa](https://getcerta.com), building a product that's being used by Fortune 500 companies.

## Motivation behind this site

I've been concerned about online privacy (not just my own, but in-general) for a while now. So in 2019, I finally started self-hosting some of the things, so that I could start taking control of some of my data. During all this time I've had chance to know about new (for me) things that could help me with my journey of regaining control of my privacy. 

This blog is mainly a publicly available notebook where I'll keep notes of "What I did and how I did it", because there have been times where I exactly needed that, when debugging something or just setting things up again. On the off-chance that someone stumbles upon this site, I hope they find something useful.
