## Motivation behind this site

Ever since I started reading the "Terms and Conditions" and "Privacy Policy" of services that I was using, I just stopped using them. Instead, I switched to self-hosted alternatives to those services, which helped me regain control over my data. 

The motivation behind this blog is to share my experience with a variery of things that are related to privacy and self-hosting.
